#IEEE HOPE Motion Sensor Project 
This project was developed as part of the **IEEE HOPE (Hands-on PCB Engineering)** class at **Howard University**, focusing on practical PCB design and embedded systems.

##Overview
A motion-activated lighting system using an **Arduino UNO**, PIR sensor **, and **relay module** to automatically trigger lights when motion is detected.

#Technologies Used
- Arduino C++
- KiCAD PCB Design
- Soldering and Circuit Assembly
- PIR Sensor and Relay Module Integration

## 🧩 Features
- Detects motion and activates a relay-controlled light
- Custom PCB layout designed in KiCAD
- Hands-on soldering and troubleshooting experience
